# dunstify is a binary built from the dunst project found here:
# https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst
# NOTE: from dunst release notes: 
#
#     Since dunstify depends on non-public parts of libnotify it may break
#     on every other libnotify version than that version that I use.
#     Because of this it does not get build and installed by default.
#     It can be build with "make dunstify". An installation target does
#     not exist.
